# LeetCode Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository**! This is where I document my journey of solving challenging problems on LeetCode while refining my skills in **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **problem-solving**.  

As a **full-stack developer** with a passion for **algorithms**, **AI**, and **puzzles**, I enjoy tackling complex problems and optimizing solutions. This repository serves as a reflection of that passion and a way to help others in the coding community.

## 📋 Contents  
- **Problems Solved**: Categorized by topic and difficulty.  
- **Languages Used**:  
  - Primarily **JavaScript** , **C++** and **Python**, with a focus on clean, efficient, and well-documented code.  

---

## 📚 Problem Categories  
Here’s how I’ve organized the solutions:  
1. **Data Structures**  
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, HashMaps.  
2. **Algorithms**  
   - Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking.  
3. **Coding Patterns**  
   - Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Topological Sort, and more.  

Each category folder contains subfolders for difficulty levels (**Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**).
